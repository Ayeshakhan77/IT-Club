# Week 2 - Data Preprocessing

This repository contains my Week 2 task for the **Data Science Internship at IT Club**.  
The focus of this week was on **data preprocessing**, which is a crucial step before any analysis or modeling.

## üìå Tasks Completed
1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Imputed missing numerical values with the column mean.  
   - Imputed missing categorical values with the mode.  

2. **Outlier Detection and Removal**  
   - Used the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** method to detect and remove outliers.  

3. **Normalization / Standardization**  
   - Applied scaling techniques (Min-Max Normalization) to bring numerical values into a consistent range.  

4. **Reusable Preprocessing Script**  
   - Created a Python script to automate repetitive cleaning steps.  

5. **Cleaned Dataset**  
   - Generated a cleaned dataset (`cleaned_data.csv`) for further analysis.
