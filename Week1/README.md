# 📊 Week 1 Task – Multilingual Mobile App Reviews Analysis  

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship (Week 1)**.  
The goal was to perform **data cleaning, exploration, and basic analysis** on a dataset of multilingual mobile app reviews.  

---

## 🔹 Dataset  
The dataset contains user reviews from a mobile application, including:  
- Review text (in multiple languages)  
- User rating (float values)  
- Other metadata about the review  

---

## 🔹 Tasks Completed  
✅ Installed Python, Jupyter Notebook, and required libraries  
✅ Loaded the dataset into Pandas for analysis  
✅ Performed sorting, filtering, grouping, and aggregation operations  
✅ Handled missing values (filled rating column nulls with mean value `3.02`)  
✅ Explored and converted data types where necessary  
✅ Documented all steps in a **Jupyter Notebook** with code + explanations  

---

## 🔹 Insights  
- Missing values were identified and handled properly.  
- Ratings distribution was explored and cleaned.  
- Grouping and aggregation provided patterns about user feedback across categories.  
- Data is now **clean, structured, and ready** for advanced analysis (sentiment analysis, NLP, etc.).

## 🌍 Impact  
Analyzing multilingual mobile app reviews helps in:  
- Understanding **user satisfaction** globally  
- Identifying **common issues** raised by users  
- Improving mobile applications through **data-driven decisions**  

---

## 📌 Next Steps  
In upcoming weeks, I will:  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations  
- Explore **sentiment analysis** on multilingual reviews  
- Derive deeper insights to support **business and product improvements**
