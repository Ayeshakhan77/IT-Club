# Week 4 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this week’s internship task was to conduct **in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights, prepare data for modeling, and create a clean engineered dataset.

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed
1. **Analyzed data distributions**  
   - Histograms, boxplots, and density plots for numerical features  
   - Outlier detection using boxplots  

2. **Studied correlations and relationships**  
   - Heatmap of correlations  
   - Pairplots for feature relationships  

3. **Feature Selection**  
   - Dropped irrelevant/duplicate features  
   - Removed highly correlated columns  
   - Encoded categorical variables  

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Log transformation for skewed features  
   - Created new derived features where applicable  

5. **Summarized Findings**  
   - Patterns and relationships between variables  
   - Data issues (missing values, outliers, skewness)  
   - Key features useful for predictive modeling

## 🚀 Next Steps
The engineered dataset will now be used for building and testing machine learning models in the upcoming weeks.
